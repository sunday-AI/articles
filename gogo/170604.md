Intel released its new Core i9 high performance series which support the latest Intel AVX-512bit(32x16) instruction set at this June 1


The importance of SIMD is getting more, as you know clock rate isn't getting faster anymore.

## Easy and fast data access 
7 years ago, you spend all that time to figure out how to parse CSV file.
Pandas makes it easy. <- Big deal
But there are data interchange and data sharing problems.

- Each system has its own internal memory format.
- 70-80% CPU wasted on serialized or deserialized
- Similar function are implemented in multiple project  


you would like to be able to take custom Python that you are writeting and use it effectivy within dstributed computing jobs, 
so. in that case Spark is getting popular but effectiveness of user-defined python running on Spark jobs still leaves a lot of desired of performance.


### points
- Specification matters more that Implementations.
- the format is needed to be flexable enohgt to handle kinds of complex, table is not just flat anymore.
